        A crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority.
        The term "crime" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted
        definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most
        popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if
        declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or
        offense (or criminal offense) is an act harmful not only to some individual but also to a
        community, society or the state ("a public wrong"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by
        law.
        <br><br>
        Showing a continuation of the downtrend
        in the last four years, Philippine National Police has a massive campaign against criminality;
        this would not be possible without the cooperation of the local residents.
        <br><br>
        There are four things to consider in investigating a crime; note taking, securing a crime
        scene, the evidence management, and the scaling management to the event.
        <br><br>
        But there are crimes
        committed were unreported to the authorities because of the fear of getting involved. Some
        people fail to report a crime due to the costs and time incurred in travelling to police stations
        that are situated far from their homes and workplaces.
        <br><br>
        This shows that the distance is also a factor that influences greatly how crimes are being
        handled with many crimes going unreported as a result. So, the researchers come up with the
        idea of making a Crime Management and Reporting System because of the awareness that
        nowadays, thereâ€™s a lot of crime happens anywhere and going to the police department and
        municipality hall is a very time consuming because they are still using manual method and it
        takes a week or two to make an action on the said complaints.
