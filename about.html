        and to be concerned about what is happening in their surroundings, the system makes the
        reporting of crime easier. The system provides users with the most reliable and complaint
        process. The simplicity and the friendliness are the advantages of this application. The
        application was made user-friendly so that anyone could access the system via login and enter
        their password and initially, users have all details without any risk.
        <br><br>
        The software is built with options such as the complaint registration, the area of the
        incident where it happens and the type of crime. In the modern world nowadays, the use of
        computer and mobile phones are becoming rampant that is why the researchers presented a
        simple but efficient, and convenient crime reporting and the requirements provided better
        perspective and very user-friendly and flexible for all the times.
        <br><br>
        The researchers used the Modified Waterfall methodology in the development of the
        system, Crime Management, and Reporting System because the approach is assertive and
        logical. This makes the development to be efficient. The system prototype allows users to report
        a crime or incident paving the way for residents to report or verify incidents by providing
        information about the incidents encountered or witnessed.
        <br><br>
        In addition, the reported address given by the complainant of the incidents is a great help
        to identify the location where common crimes happened. The result of the system showed that
        the potential users are willing to participate and already recognized the usefulness of the system.
        The willingness of the police to use the system and their recognition of its usefulness is enough
        to try the system for community use.
